# Improve project

## Overview

Implement an improvement from IMPROVEMENTS.md.

## Steps

1. **Planing the improvement**
    * Read IMPROVEMENTS.md
    * Use context7
    * Formulate a plan
    * Focus on small incremental steps
    * Each step should be a vertical slice, fully tested and integrated
    * After proposing the plan, pause and wait for approval before continuing

2. **Implementing the plan**
    * Work on a single vertical slice at a time
    * Write tests first to guide the implementation
    * Implement the minimum amount of code to solve the issue
    * Once a step is completed, pause and wait for a review and an approval
    * Commit and continue on the next step of the plan
